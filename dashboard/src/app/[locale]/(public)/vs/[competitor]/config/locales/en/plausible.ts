Both are great alternatives to Google Analytics if privacy matters to you.\n\nThe difference? Betterlytics includes session replay, user journey tracking, and monitoring. Plausible keeps things minimal on purpose. If you need behavioral insights beyond pageviews and conversions, we've got you covered.`,

      title: 'Privacy-Safe Session Replay',
      content: `Plausible skips session replay entirely to stay maximally private. Fair choice. But it means you can't see where users click, where they get stuck, or why they leave.\n\nWe include session replay while staying cookieless and privacy-compliant. No cross-site tracking, you control what gets recorded. The behavioral insights you need with strong privacy safeguards.`,

      title: 'One Tool Instead of Three',
      content: `Plausible does core analytics really well: pageviews, referrers, conversions, funnels. Clean and focused. But when you need uptime monitoring or performance tracking, you're adding more tools.\n\nBetterlytics bundles analytics, session replay, user journeys, and monitoring with alerts via Slack, Discord, and more in one place. One dashboard, one bill, same privacy standards across everything.`,

You get session replay, monitoring, user journeys included. More features, lower starting price.`,

If you just need pageviews, referrers, and conversion goals with zero extra surface area, Plausible's focused product and established brand might be the more comfortable choice.\n\nBetterlytics adds session replay, journeys, performance insights, and monitoring without abandoning that privacy baseline. If you're ready for deeper behavior insight and fewer vendors, the extra capability is already built in; no extra tools to stitch together.`,
