          "title": "How We Started",
          "p1": "Betterlytics was born out of real frustration. Our team was developing a Vendor Management System when we hit a wall with web analytics. Every solution we evaluated forced us into the same impossible choice: either compromise our users' privacy or settle for inadequate insights.",
          "p2": "Traditional analytics tools force you to choose between comprehensive insights and user privacy. We believe that's a false choice. Betterlytics proves you can have powerful, actionable analytics while being completely privacy-compliant and respectful of your visitors.",
          "p3": "What started as a solution for our own needs became something much bigger: a mission to build analytics tools that respect both website owners and their visitors. Every feature is designed with privacy and performance as equal priorities."

          "title": "Why Privacy-First Analytics Matter",
          "p1": "The web analytics industry has been dominated by surveillance capitalism for too long. Major analytics providers collect vast amounts of personal data, track users across websites, and use this information to build detailed behavioral profiles for advertising purposes.",
          "p2": "We don't believe website owners should have to compromise their visitors' privacy to understand how their site performs. Betterlytics collects only the essential metrics you need: no cookies, no personal data, no cross-site tracking. Your visitors' privacy is respected by default."

          "title": "Privacy and Performance in Perfect Balance",
          "p1": "We obsess over both privacy and performance equally because your website's speed matters just as much as your visitors' privacy. Our tracking script weighs less than 2KB. Compare that to Google Analytics' bloated 45KB+ payload. Built with modern web standards and optimized for speed, Betterlytics won't slow down your site.",
          "p2": "Under the hood, we use cutting-edge technology: Rust for high-performance data processing, ClickHouse for lightning-fast analytical queries, and Next.js 15 for a modern, responsive dashboard experience. Every technical decision prioritizes both user privacy and system performance."

While we don't have a public API yet, every dashboard feature is thoroughly documented to help you get the most out of your analytics."
