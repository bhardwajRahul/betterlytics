# Notifications

Get notified in Slack, Discord, Teams, or on your phone when a monitor detects downtime, recovery, or SSL issues. Configure where your alerts go from the integrations settings page.

Notifications are triggered by monitor events and delivered instantly. If multiple integrations are connected, alerts are sent to all active channels.

## Setting Up an Integration

1. Navigate to **Dashboard > Settings > Integrations**
2. Click **Add** on the platform you want to connect
3. Follow the setup link in the dialog to create or retrieve your webhook URL or find your credentials
4. Paste them into the form and click **Save**

Betterlytics sends a test message when you first connect an integration to confirm everything is working.

## Webhook Payload Format

The generic webhook integration sends a `POST` request with `Content-Type: application/json` to your URL. This is useful for connecting custom services or automation platforms like Zapier, n8n, or Make.

```json
{
  "title": "example.com is down",
  "message": "MyMonitor (https://example.com) is not responding",
  "url": "https://betterlytics.io/dashboard/abc123/monitor/abc123",
  "url_title": "View Dashboard"
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `title` | string | Notification title |
| `message` | string | Notification body text |
| `url` | string (optional) | Link to the relevant dashboard page |
| `url_title` | string (optional) | Display label for the link |

You can test your webhook endpoint with `curl`:

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-webhook-url \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title": "Test", "message": "Hello from Betterlytics"}'
```
